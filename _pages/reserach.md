> **TL;DR**&emsp; Meta-DETR is a state-of-the-art few-shot object detector that performs image-level meta-learning-based prediction and effectively exploits the inter-class correlation to enhance generalization from old knowledge to new classes. Meta-DETR entirely bypasses the proposal quality gap between base and novel classes, thus achieving superior performance than R-CNN-based few-shot object detectors. In addition, Meta-DETR performs meta-learning on a set of support classes at one go, thus effectively leveraging the inter-class correlation for better generalization.

>
> **TL;DR**&emsp; This paper presents SAM-DETR -- an efficeint DETR-like object detector that can converge wihtin 12 epochs and outperform the strong Faster R-CNN (w/ FPN) baseline. This paper proposes the semantic-aligned matching mechanism to accelerate DETR's training convergence.

>
> **TL;DR**&emsp; Defect samples are usually rare and expensive to label. This paper presents Defect-GAN to perform high-fidelity defect synthesis with many normal samples and a limited number of defect samples. We show that synthesized defect samples can be effectively leveraged to boost inspection accuracy. The technique is patent-protected and is being used in real scenarios.

>
> **TL;DR**&emsp; We achieve realistic and vivid facial expression editing by designing separate branches focusing on certain areas (e.g., eyes, noses), and perform the expression transformation in a cascaded manner.

>
> **TL;DR**&emsp; One of the earliest works to apply Faster R-CNN to rotated object detection in remote sensing images. The proposed CAD-Net effectively uses multi-level contextual information for robust object detection for satellite imagery.
